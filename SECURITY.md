# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest code on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Open a private security advisory on GitHub, if available.
- If that is not available, open an issue with minimal public detail and request a private contact path.

Please include:

- Affected version/tag
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

I will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix/release.
