    // camera can still be settling at the end of a turn while a fast enemy attack - one with no
    // cast to speak of - is already running, and a parry you cannot see is a parry you cannot make.

    // the request lock gated on an active enemy turn, and the writer stop that catches the player's
    // own turn where AwaitingTurnEnd is false. Monster ON with Character OFF is a state nobody has
