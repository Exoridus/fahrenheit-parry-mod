///     Difficulty presets for the press-based parry window and its animation-backed
///     whiff recovery lockout.
///
///     The mod no longer uses a tiered anti-spam window; a single window duration is
///     applied on every fresh press, and a whiff that does not connect enters a
///     time-bounded recovery lockout that approximates the visible native
///     "return to guard stance" animation.
///
///     <para>
///         Everything is counted in <b>battle ticks</b>; milliseconds are derived, never stored.
///         Both endpoints of a parry are tick-locked. The press is read from the game's own input
///         word, which the game refreshes once per tick, so a press at 0.6 of a frame becomes
///         visible on the next one — the 0.6 never exists. The impact arrives from
///         MsSetDamageInternal, also on a tick. The only continuous quantity in the old model was
///         the real elapsed time subtracted from the window each frame, and that injected
///         wall-clock drift into a tick-based simulation: one dropped frame burns two ticks of
///         window while the enemy animation and the impact stall with it.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A window of W ms admits exactly <c>floor(W / 33.33) + 1</c> impacts, and the fraction
///         beyond that does nothing — except when W lands exactly on a tick, where float residue
///         and frame pacing decide. Normal's old 200 ms was exactly 6.0 ticks. Counting ticks
///         removes the coin flip.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Difficulty no longer moves the window.</b> At 30 Hz a tighter window punishes
///         perception and hardware rather than skill. Difficulty stays on the windows — the tiers
///         below reproduce the values the mod shipped with, which played well — but the arithmetic
///         is now honest, and two accidents of the old model are gone. Debug is not a difficulty;
///         it is a testing aid.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Accident one:</b> the dodge window had no tiers at all. It was two constants,
///         <c>350 ms</c> for release and <c>800 ms</c> for DEBUG, selected by build configuration
///         rather than by difficulty.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Accident two:</b> Expert paid twice — the tightest window *and* the longest recovery
///         (750 ms against Normal's 600). Its lockout is now 500 ms. Total commitment is no longer
///         the authored number; with per-tier windows the lockout is what you tune, and the
